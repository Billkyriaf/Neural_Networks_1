\subsection{Objective}

This assignment will implement the algorithms found in those libraries in C++ to the best ability of the author. The goal is to
create a flexible framework that can be used to create and train neural networks. The neural networks will be fully connected. 
The framework will be able to create and train neural networks with any number of layers and any number of neurons per layer.
Also there will be the ability to choose the activation function for each layer and the initialization method for the weights.

\subsection{Methodology}
\subsubsection{Fully connected neural networks}

Fully connected neural networks are networks where each neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer. Every
layer has a predetermined number of neurons. The first layer is the input layer and the last layer is the output layer. The input
layer in this project will be 748 neurons, one for each pixel in the MNIST dataset. The output layer will be 10 neurons, one for
each digit.

\subsubsection{Network evaluation}
Once the network is created, the weights are initialized and the training begins. In order to determine the optimal parameters 
for the network, such as the learning rate, the number of epochs, the number of neurons per layer, the activation function and the
initialization method, the network will be trained with different combinations of these parameters. The performance of the network
will be measured by the accuracy of the network on the test set.
