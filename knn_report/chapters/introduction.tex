\subsection*{Assignment description}
The main point of focus of this project is to compare the KNN ans the K-means classification algorithms. For the 
purposes of this assignment the MNIST data set was used. The code for this assignment can be found in 
\href{https://github.com/Billkyriaf/Neural_Networks_1}{this} GitHub repository.

\subsection*{The MNIST dataset}
"The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and
a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized 
and centered in a fixed-size image.

It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data
while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting." \cite{mnist} 

Each image is a 28x28 pixel gray-scale image. All the images are labeled with the correct digit. The purpose of this assignment
is to create two + 1 classification algorithms that are able to identify the images in the test dataset.

\subsection*{State of the Art}

Due to the fact that the MNIST dataset is a very well known dataset, there are many successful attempts in the classification.
The majority of them use th python language and a relative library.
