## Project description
 This project has two parts. The first part is an implementation of the KNN and K-means algorithms. The second part is an implementation of the back propagation algorithm for training a neural network. Both parts are implemented in C++ and use the MNIST dataset.

 The code for the first part is in the [`knn_classifier`](https://github.com/Billkyriaf/Neural_Networks_1/tree/main/knn_classifier) folder and the code for the second part is in the [`nn_project`](https://github.com/Billkyriaf/Neural_Networks_1/tree/main/nn_project) folder.

 The report for the first part is in the [`knn_report`](https://github.com/Billkyriaf/Neural_Networks_1/blob/main/knn_report/knn_report.pdf) folder and the report for the second part is in the [`nn_report`](https://github.com/Billkyriaf/Neural_Networks_1/blob/main/nn_report/nn_report.pdf) folder.
